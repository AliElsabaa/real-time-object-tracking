# ðŸ“Œ Real-Time Object Tracking with YOLOv12 and OpenCV  

ðŸš€ A real-time object tracking system using **YOLOv12** for detection and **OpenCV** for tracking. The system automatically re-detects lost objects and resumes tracking.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview  
This project uses a **YOLOv12 object detection model** to detect objects in a live webcam feed.  
The user can select an object to track by clicking on it, and the system will keep tracking it using OpenCV's **CSRT tracker**.  
If the object is lost, the system will attempt to re-detect it.
